## Project Summary

Our proposed final project is to reverse entropy.

## Code

All code files can be found in the `code/` directory. To run the code:

1. Compile using `g++ main.cpp`

2. Run using `./a.out`

3. Insert any entropy value (as long as it is an integer!)

## Data

Our test data was taken using preliminary rock data, stored as a .txt file in the `data/` directory.

## Documents

Our signed contract and development log can be found in the `documents/` directory.

## Feedback

All feedback from our project mentor can be found in the `feedback/` directory.
