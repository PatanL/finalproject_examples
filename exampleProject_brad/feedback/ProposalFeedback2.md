### Comments
There is a minor flaw in your description of the leading question.

**On the leading question:**
Although you explicitly state the dataset and the algorithm you want to use to solve your leading question, it is not clear how landmark path can be used to solve your leading question. Landmark path takes as input a specific list of 'landmarks' that must be visited in order, but there are many possible 'landmarks' on each continent. Do you plan to perform a separate landmark path run for every permutation of cities from each continent?
