### Comments
There is a major flaw in your proposal's dataset description of the dataset and a minor flaw in your dataset's description of the leading question. 

**On the dataset:**
The algorithms and leading question you are proposing requires a weighted graph dataset, but the format of your dataset is only loosely described (and upon inspection is not clearly weighted). Please provide more details about the actual columns / values in the dataset and how you will process the input dataset so that it matches the input / output you describe in the algorithms.

**On the leading question:**
Your leading question is not explicitly answered by the algorithms / dataset. Please clarify exactly what output from what algorithm will directly find the shortest path between two chosen points. In other words, what is the format of your final deliverable and how will you use that output to answer the question?
