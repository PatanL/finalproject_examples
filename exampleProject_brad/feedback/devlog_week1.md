### Comments

While you successfully submitted your first development log, it was sparse on details. In particular, it is not clear *who* accomplished a particular task nor was it clear *what* progress was actually made. Next week, when describing the actual activities done by the team, try to phrase the report in the form of '(netid) completed (task) with (measure of success)' or '(netid) worked on (task) by (concrete details)'.
