This week our team's target goals were to write a fake development log entry and reverse entropy. While we were successful in writing the first one by making a reasonable example, reversing entropy proved to be harder then expected and will probably take at least another week. 

The development log entry did not take more than a few hours to write -- we focused primarily on what expectations or goals I set for the week, how much we actually accomplished, and a brief description of any problems we encountered along the way. 

We made some small progress in reversing entropy by sticking some water in the freezer but it turned out that this actually took more energy then it 'reduced' so we will have to try something else. Maybe reducing potential energy in some stationary objects will work?

Our goals for next week are (1) to write another development log entry and (2) to push some rocks down a hill as a method of reducing entropy.

Based on week 1's feedback, this week our team's goals were to write a better, more structured development log entry, identify a target dataset, and build a small test set for our reserving entropy function.

Bradsol identified a dataset consisting of annual weather data (https://weather.com/) but we once again realized that decreasing temperatures is not actually reversing entropy as the measurements were not taken in a closed system.

Gcevans (working with bross) wrote a Catch-framework based test suite for our code and confirms that our reverse function works (but not on unsigned integers). 

lh1 was sick and was not able to attend the weekly meeting. However they did send a video of them pushing rocks down a hill along with some preliminary data about how much energy was transferred to friction and the number of total paths the rocks took. 

Our goals for next week are to (1) implement an unsigned int reverse function and (2) to write a graph-based visualizer for rock movement down a hill.
